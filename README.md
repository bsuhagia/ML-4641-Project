# Project Plan

### Week of 6/7
* Change topic from sentiment analysis to stock market clustering and predictions.
* Create informal project proposal.

### Week of 6/14
* Determine as a group which stocks we would like to perform our analysis on. Currently, we are looking forward to analyzing SP500 stocks.
* Determine as a group what time periods we would like to look at in order to avoid outlier years.
* Get all group members familiar with scikit-learn and R through individual exploration.
* Gather all data from the stocks and convert into a format needed for analysis

### Week of 6/21
* Produce visualization graphics using dummy data
* Create and test different models created using different algorithms

### Week of 6/28
* Create a visualization that demonstrates our results
* If we get good results play with the data and attempt to do predictions on stock prices given related stocks. This would be a form of a supervised learning done by altering the data to be given stock prices of the cluster and have to predict what our stock will be.
* Begin work on the project progress report.

### Week of 7/5
* Finish project progress report.
* Attempt to use alternative algorithms to cluster the data.
* Begin work on final project report.

### Week of 7/12
* Finish final project report.
* Begin working on the project presentation.

# Individual Tasks

### Task 1: Gathering data using R or Python (everyone)
* Gather data using R or Python techniques
* Saving the data in correct file formats for future analysis

### Task 2: Determining the most important attributes to use and what types of machine learning techniques should be implemented (in short Data manipulation)
* Analyze importance of each attribute
* Adding or removing attributes
* Determine what type of algorithms would work best	

### Task 3: Generating and testing models.
* Design and create the optimal models using basic and advanced algorithms
* Support Vector Machines
* K-Nearest Neighbor
* Expectation Maximization
* Density-Based Clustering
* Test the methods on the data
* Modify and optimize the methods based on the testing

### Task 4: Visualizing results
* Finding trends in the data results
* Creating charts and graphs to visualize the trends
* Creating network structure to represent similarities between different stocks

### Task 5: Writing the final report
* Combine the visual results along with the concluding ideas to form a final report

### Task 6: Create the Presentation
* Use charts and graphs to present the trends found in our data and analysis results
